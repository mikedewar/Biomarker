Finding Biomarkers From Array Data
==================================

This project aims to select discriminative proteins from large microarray studies for use as biomarkers in subsequent experiments. The possible space of discriminative probesets can be limited a priori. 

The project code is written in R, and the aim is to eventually generate a Bioconductor pacakge to wrap this up as an easy to use function.
